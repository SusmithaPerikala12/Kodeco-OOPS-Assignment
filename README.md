# Kodeco-OOPS-Assignment

#Exercise 1
This exercise focuses on defining a class Post to model a social media post. It demonstrates creating properties for the postâ€™s data and a method display() to format and print the information. This reinforces the concept of classes encapsulating data and functionality.

#Exercise 2
This exercise focuses on applying composition and the Singleton design pattern to create a more flexible shopping cart system.
This exercise incorporates the Singleton design pattern. The DiscountStrategy protocol defines a common interface for calculating discounts. Concrete strategies like NoDiscountStrategy and PercentageDiscountStrategy provide specific implementations. The ShoppingCart class holds a reference to a DiscountStrategy object, allowing you to dynamically change the discount behavior applied.

#Exercise 3
This exercise defines a protocol PaymentProcessor with a method processPayment that throws an error. Concrete classes CreditCardProcessor and CashProcessor conform to the protocol, showcasing the use of protocols for defining common functionality across different payment methods. The assignment emphasizes error handling using try-catch blocks to catch potential PaymentError throws from the processors, demonstrating how to handle errors gracefully in protocol-oriented programming.
